  This repository contains the source code of GraphRAG
  Dialogue Insights (GDI). 


  GDI enables users to query work items from issue-tracking
  systems (represented as a knowledge graph) using natural
  language. In addition to a natural language response, GDI
  returns supporting information to help users understand
  how the LLM queries the knowledge graph. The technologies
  used in this repository, such as Streamlit, Neo4j, and
  Cypher, are modular and can be interchanged.


  You can use this repository to:
  1. Interact with GDI to determine its suitability for your
  context.
  2. Connect your own knowledge graph and query work items
  using natural language.
  3. Reproduce the results presented in the "Related Publication" section by following the steps outlined in the "Steps to Reproduce" section.

  Note: Note: We provide the open-source knowledge graph. Due to confidentiality agreements,
  we are unable to share the proprietary knowledge graph used in our study. 
  To use GDI with your own data, you have to create a custom knowledge graph. Our paper offers
  an overview of the knowledge graph construction process. For more detailed instructions, refer to
  the book "How to Build a Knowledge Graph" by Fensel et al. https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-37439-6_2.
